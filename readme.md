**Wine Quality Prediction 🍷**

This project leverages Machine Learning to predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties. By analyzing features such as acidity, sugar, and alcohol levels, the model identifies the key factors that contribute to a high-quality wine rating.

**📌 Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately categorize wine quality scores. This involves a full data science pipeline, from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to model evaluation.

Key Features:
Data Analysis: Detailed examination of chemical features like Citric Acid, Sulphates, and Alcohol.

Visualizations: Use of Seaborn heatmaps to identify feature correlations and bar plots to visualize trends.

Machine Learning: Implementation of a Random Forest Classifier to handle complex, non-linear data patterns.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Language: Python

Libraries: 

 Pandas (Data Manipulation)

Seaborn & Matplotlib (Visualization)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)

**📊 Workflow**

Data Loading: Importing the wine dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Checking for missing values and data distribution.

Visualizing relationships using sns.barplot and sns.heatmap.

Preprocessing: Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Model Training: Training the Random Forest model on the training data.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy scores and classification reports.
